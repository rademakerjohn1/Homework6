# WEATHER DASHBOARD READ-ME

This application uses a third-party API to retrieve data and display current weather and 5-day forecast for a user-selected city.

The application will save any valid search in local storage and display it as a list item to be called upon again.

The application will display the most recently searched city's weather on loading.

The clear button will clear any saved local storage and empty the corresponding list.
